# NeuralNavierStokes

Tutorials for learning neural closure models for various discretized PDEs,
including

- The viscous [Burgers](burgers.jl) equations in 1D
- The incompressible [Navier-Stokes](navier_stokes_spectral.jl) equations in 2D

See the script [`make.jl`](./make.jl) for converting the script to a markdown
file or Jupyter notebook.
